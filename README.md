**VC Verifier Library** is a comprehensive Java/Kotlin library designed to enable the validation and verification of **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**, a crucial component in modern decentralized identity systems. This library provides a robust mechanism for verifying the authenticity and integrity of VCs, ensuring that the claims made within the credential are both valid and trustworthy.

#### Key Features:

-   **VC Validation**: The library validates the structure, signatures, and expiration of Verifiable Credentials to ensure they conform to the W3C VC standards.
-   **Cryptographic Signature Verification**: Supports the verification of cryptographic signatures using public keys, including EdDSA, RSA, and other supported algorithms, ensuring the integrity of the credential.
-   **Compatibility with Various Data Models**: It supports multiple VC data models (e.g., VC 1.1, VC 2.0), ensuring compatibility across various decentralized identity systems.

#### Supported VC Formats:
-   ldp_vc
-   mso_mdoc

#### Supported Algorithms:
-   PS256
-   RS256
-   EdDSA (Ed25519)

#### Proof Types Supported:
-   RsaSignature2018
-   Ed25519Signature2018
-   Ed25519Signature2020
